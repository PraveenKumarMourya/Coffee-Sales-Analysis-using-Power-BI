Excited to showcase a Power BI dashboard I created to analyze 6 months of sales data from a coffee shop chain — and the results brewed some powerful insights! 🚀
With interactive visuals, slicers, KPIs, and dynamic charts, I explored:

🕒 Hourly Sales Trends

📍 Store Location Performance

📦 Product Category Breakdown

📅 Weekday Patterns

👣 Customer Footfall

# 🔍 Key Insights Discovered:

🕘 Peak Hours: Sales surge from 6 AM to 10 AM, driven by the morning coffee rush.

🥤 Size Preference: Most customers prefer Regular and Large size beverages — especially in peak hours.

# 📦 Product Category Highlights:

☕ Coffee leads in sales volume and revenue.

🍩 Snacks & Pastries complement coffee and perform best in the morning

🧋 Cold Beverages see a spike during afternoons.

🎁 Merchandise & Add-ons sell better on weekends.

📍 Location Trends: Urban and transit-area stores outperform others — high footfall = higher conversion.

📅 Weekday Patterns:Midweek (Tues–Thurs) shows consistent high sales across categories.

# 💡 Actionable Recommendations:
1. 🥐 Launch Morning Bundles: Coffee + Pastry deals from 6–10 AM.
2. 🎯 Product Focus: Promote coffee + snacks in AM, and cold beverages in PM.
3. 🏪 Optimize Staffing: Align staff schedules with peak hours and top-performing stores.
4. 🧾 Smart Inventory: Stock up on popular sizes and categories in high-traffic time slots.
5. 📣 Weekend Merchandising: Highlight gift items and add-ons when traffic is more casual.

🛠️ Power BI Features Used:
✅ KPI Cards for Total Sales, Average Order Value, Peak Hour Orders
📊 Bar & Line Charts for hourly and weekday trends
🧩 Slicers to dynamically filter by store, product category, time, and weekday
🧠 DAX Measures for custom calculations and insights

📈 This project shows how Power BI can transform raw data into real business strategy. Visual, interactive, and insights-driven.
